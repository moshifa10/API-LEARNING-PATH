# Here I will be learning how to use an API and how to intergrate it to my programmes

''' 
    An API is like a waiter 🍽️
    - Your program = customer
    - API = waiter
    - Server (Google Calendar) = kitchen

    Me:
        - “Give me my events”

    API:
        - “Here they are (in JSON format)”
